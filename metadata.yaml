description: "Ghost Stories of an Antiquary is the title of M. R. James' first collection\
  \ of ghost stories, published in 1904 (some had previously appeared in magazines).\
  \ Some later editions under this title contain both the original collection and\
  \ its successor, More Ghost Stories (1911), combined in one volume.\nMontague Rhodes\
  \ James (1862â€“1936) was a paleographer and medievalist scholar; Provost of King's\
  \ College, Cambridge. He wrote many of his ghost stories to be read aloud in the\
  \ long tradition of spooky Christmas Eve tales. His stories often use rural settings,\
  \ with a quiet, scholarly protagonist getting caught up in the activities of supernatural\
  \ forces. The details of horror are almost never explicit, the stories relying on\
  \ a gentle, bucolic background to emphasise the awfulness of the otherworldly intrusions.\
  \ His style of writing can be considered as \"gothic\".\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
